>>> What is terraform

```
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. 

It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative and version-controlled manner. 
With Terraform, you can define the desired state of your infrastructure using a domain-specific language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
